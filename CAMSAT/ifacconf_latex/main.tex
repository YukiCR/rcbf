   % Miniaturization and clustering exacerbate collision risk of future satellites.
   % In this paper, we propose a distributed framework for inter-satellite collision avoidance with tunable priority.
   % We first deduce the collision-free condition of multi-satellite systems based on High Order Control Barrier Function techniques. 
   % We then decouple such a condition for respective satellites, and further encode safety on the nominal controller in the form of distributed safety filter.
   % By introducing priority parameter in the safety filter, the responsibility of evading collisions between satellite pairs becomes tunable, making it possible to modify the swarm behavior.
   % Based on such a mechanism, we further showcase the safety filter's ability to cooperate with high level decisions: cooperating with optimization to approximate global optimal behavior and cooperating with Large Language Models to accommodate to tasks, respectively.
   % Theoretical analysis have proved the safety guarantee of the safety filter and numerical Experiments validated the effectiveness of proposed method.

   Satellite miniaturization and dense constellation deployments exacerbate collision risks in future orbital operations. 
   While numerous collision avoidance strategies have been proposed, few reconcile agent-level safety with mission-level efficiency.
   In this paper, we propose a distributed inter-satellite collision avoidance framework embeded with high-level tuned priorities.
   First, we formulate ``safe protocol'' constraints between satellite pairs and enforce these constraints on their nominal controllers through distributed safety filters, which establishs collision-free coordination of the whole swarm.
   By introducing tunable priority parameters within the safety filter, collision evasion responsibilities become dynamically adjustable, enabling swarm behavior adaptation. 
   We further demonstrate two methods to integrate with high-level decisions: cooperating with optimization to approximate global reference behaviors and cooperating with Large Language Models to accommodate to tasks, respectively.
   Theoretical analysis proves the safety guarantees, while numerical experiments validate the framework's efficacy.

\section{Preliminaries}
\par We review High Order Control Barrier Function here, which is the fundamental technique in this paper.

Consider a general continuous time control-affine system
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:system}
  \dot{\boldsymbol{x}} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{x}) + \boldsymbol{g}(\boldsymbol{x}) \boldsymbol{u} ,
\end{equation}
where $x \in \mathcal{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is the state and $u \in \mathcal{U} \subset \mathbb{R}^m$ is the system input. $\boldsymbol{f}$ and $\boldsymbol{g}$ are locally Lipschitz continuous functions. The high order control barrier function is defined as follows.

\begin{definition}\label{def:HOCBF}
   Given a system (\ref{eqn:system}) with relative degree $r_b$ and $r_b$-th order differentiable function $h(\boldsymbol{x})$, define a series of functions $\Psi_r, r = 0, \dots, r_b$ recursively as
   \begin{equation} \label{eqn:cbfRecursive}
     \begin{aligned}
       \Psi_0 &= h(\boldsymbol{x}), \\
       \Psi_k &= \dot{\Psi}_{k-1} + \alpha_k\left( \Psi_{k-1}(\boldsymbol{x}) \right), k = 1,\dots,r_b,
     \end{aligned}
   \end{equation}
   where $\alpha_k(\cdot)$ are extended class $\mathcal{K}_{\infty}$ functions \footnotemark. 
   
   \par The zero-superlevel set of these defined functions are
   \footnotetext{A continuous function $\alpha$ : $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is an extended class $\mathcal{K}_{\infty}$ function if $\alpha(0) = 0$ and $\lim_{x\to \pm \infty}(x) = \pm \infty$.}
   \begin{equation}
     \mathfrak{S}_r = \left\{ \boldsymbol{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \Psi_r(\boldsymbol{x}) \ge 0 \right\}, r = 0,\dots,r_b.
   \end{equation}
   $h$ is a \textit{High Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF)} for system (\ref{eqn:system}), if there exists extended class $\mathcal{K}_{\infty}$ functions $\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_{r_b}$ such that
   \begin{equation} \label{eqn:cbfConstraint}
     \Psi_{r_b}(\boldsymbol{x}) \ge 0
   \end{equation}
   stands for any $(\boldsymbol{x},t) \in \mathfrak{S} \times [0,\infty]$, where $\mathfrak{S} = \bigcap_{r = 0}^{r_b} \mathfrak{S}_r$. 

\end{definition}

\begin{thm}[\cite{HOCBFxiaowei}]
   \par Following the definitions in Definition \ref{def:HOCBF}, once $h$ is a HOCBF for system (\ref{eqn:system}), $\mathfrak{S}$ would be a \textit{forward invariant set} for the system, i.e., $\boldsymbol{x}(0) \in \mathfrak{S}, \boldsymbol{x}(t) \in \mathfrak{S}, \forall t > 0$.
\end{thm}

\section{Problem Formulation}
\subsection{System Modelling}
\par We consider $N$ satellite agents whose dynamics governed by Clohessy-Wiltshire equantions \cite[]{CWequations}.
The dynamics of agent $i$ in the reference orbit frame is described as
\begin{equation}
   \dot{\boldsymbol{x}}_i = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
         \dot{\boldsymbol{p}}_i \\ \dot{\boldsymbol{v}}_i
      \end{bmatrix} = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
         \boldsymbol{v}_i \\ \boldsymbol{f}_{vi}
      \end{bmatrix} + 
      \begin{bmatrix}
         \boldsymbol{0} \\ E
      \end{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{u}_i,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
   \boldsymbol{f}_{vi} = 
      \begin{bmatrix}
         -2 \omega v_{yi} \\
         2\omega v_{xi} + 3\omega^2 v_{yi} \\
         \omega^2 p_{zi}
      \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{p}_i = [p_{xi}~p_{yi}~p_{zi}]^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^3, \boldsymbol{v} = [v_{xi}~v_{yi}~v_{zi}]^\top \in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $\boldsymbol{u}_i \in \mathbb{R}^3$ are the position, velocity and acceleration of agent $i$, respectively.
$\boldsymbol{0}$ and $E$ are zero matrix and identity matrix with proper size, and $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$ is the angular velocity of the reference orbit.

\begin{assumption}
$\boldsymbol{x}_j, j = 1, \dots, N$ and $\omega$ are known for any agent $i, i = 1, \dots, N$ and the high-level decision module.
\end{assumption}
\par This assumption is justified since agent $i$ could estimate the state of agent $j$ through relative position estimation techniques \cite[]{XXX}, and the high-level decision module (possibly ground control station or space station) could get these information through observation \cite[]{XXX} or communication.

\subsection{Safety Requirement}
\par The safety requirement of satellite agents is to keep the safety distance between from each other. 
Denote $r_i \in \mathbb{R}^+$ to be the safety distance of agent $i$, the safety requirement between agent $i$ and agent $j$ is then keeping the set
\begin{equation}
   \mathfrak{S}_{0ij} = \{\boldsymbol{x}_i, \boldsymbol{x}_j \mid d_{ij} = \| \boldsymbol{p}_i - \boldsymbol{p}_j \| \ge R_{ij} = r_i + r_j \}
\end{equation}
forward invariant. 
And the safety requirement of the swarm is to keep 
\begin{equation}
   \mathfrak{S}_0 = \bigcap_{i \neq j}\mathfrak{S}_{0ij}, ~i,j = 1, \dots, N
\end{equation}
forward invariant.

\subsection{Main Objective}
\par The main objective of this paper is twofold:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
   \item Ensuring agent-level safety: for each agent $i$, given the local reference control $\boldsymbol{u}_{ri}$ and observation $\boldsymbol{X} = [\boldsymbol{x}_1^{\top}~\dots~\boldsymbol{x}_n^{\top}]^{\top}$, synthesis the safeguarding policy $\boldsymbol{u}_i = \boldsymbol{\pi}_{i}(\boldsymbol{u}_{ri}, \boldsymbol{X})$ to keep $\mathfrak{S}_0$ forward invariant for the swarm through control $\boldsymbol{U} = [\boldsymbol{u}_1^\top~\dots~\boldsymbol{u}_N^\top]^\top$.
   \item Cooperating with high-level decisions: 
      \begin{itemize}
         \item Given the global reference control $\boldsymbol{U}_r = [\boldsymbol{u}_{gr1}^{\top}~\dots~\boldsymbol{u}_{grn}]^\top$, tune $\boldsymbol{\pi}_i, i = 1, \dots, N$ to approximate $\boldsymbol{U}_r$ with $\boldsymbol{U}$.
         \item Given the mission discribed with nature language, tune $\boldsymbol{\pi}_i, i = 1, \dots, N$ to adjust the collision evasion responsibily of agent $i$ based on its mission-level importance. 
      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Distributed Safety Filter Design}
\par We first introduce the ``safe protocol'' constraint formulation, then give the distributed safety filter design based on the ``safe protocol''. 

\par For satellite $i$ and satellite $j$, the ``safe protocol'' set for satellite $i$ with satellite $j$ is 
\begin{equation}
   \begin{aligned}
      \mathcal{S}_{ij} = \{ \boldsymbol{u}_i \mid -\boldsymbol{n}_{ij}^\top \boldsymbol{u}_i \le& -\boldsymbol{n}_{ij}[(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\boldsymbol{v}_i + \boldsymbol{f}_i] \\
      &+ p_{ij}[\alpha_1 \alpha_2 (d_{ij} - R_{ij}) \\
      &+ \frac{1}{d_{ij}}(\|\boldsymbol{v}_{12}\|^2 - ( \boldsymbol{n}_{12}^{\top}\boldsymbol{v}_{12} )^2 )] \}
   \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
