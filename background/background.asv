This is the background of manage priority of satellites for inter-satellite collision avoidance.
+ For each satellite i, give a positive real number p_i as the priority. 
    The higher p_i, the more priority the satellite get.
    Consequently, the satellite experiences less control modification to avoide collision, which may influence its task and maneuver.
+ 1-st level: Mission critical satellites should get the highest priority. =
    These satellites include Military and Defense Satellites, Navigation and Timing Augmentation Satellites, Monitoring the collision risk of space station, etc.
+ 2-elvel: Satellites that are not suitable to experience control modification should get relatively higher priority.
    These satellites include satellites with low fuel, the leader satellites in leader-follower satellite swarms, etc.
+ 4-level: Satellites that are backup or redundant get lowest priority, since they would not influence the mission.
+ 3-level: Other satellites gets priority higher than backup or redundant satellites, and lower than satellites that are not suitable to experience control modification.
    All satellite that are not given details should be in this class.
+ If two satellites are in the same class and given details, you can set the priority based on the prompt and your knowledge to decide which one should get higher p_i.
    If no difference in the

This this the format you should follow:
+ use json format to output, the key is "PriorityArray", the value is the priority array value
+ the element i is the priority value of agent i
+ so you should output 
    {
        "PriorityArray": [p_1, p_2, ..., p_last]
    }

Whole example:
say we have 7 satellites, satellite 1,2 a military satellite (and satellite 2 more important), satellite 3 a satellite with low fuel, satellite 6 a backup satellite, other satellites have no detail.
Solving:
1. First decide which satellite is in which level: 
    satellite 1, 2 are military satellites, so mission critical, so all in level-1.
    satellite 3 has low fuel, so not suitable to control modification, so in level-2.
    satellite 6 a backup satellite, so in level-4.
    satellite 4, 5, 7 are not given detail, so all in level-3, which means common satellites.
2. Assign priority based on level: 
    priority should follow level-1 > level-2 > level-3 > level-4, 
    hence we set satellite 1 and 2 : p_1 = 8, p_2 = 8, 
                 satellite 3 : p_3 = 6,
                 satellite 4, 5, 7 : p_4 = p_5 = p_7 = 4, 
                 satellite 6 : p_6 = 1;
3. Modify priority in the same level (but still follow level-1 > level-2 > level-3 > level-4):
    satellite 1 and 2 are in the same level, and prompt informed that satellite 2 more important, so
    we modify p_2 = 9
    satellite 4, 5, 6 are in the same level, but no detailed information given, so we do not modify them
4. check 2 is satisfied, if not do 3 and 4 again:
    we checked priority should follow level-1 > level-2 > level-3 > level-4, 
    so we continue to next step
3. get priority array:
    give the array in the asked format, that is:
    [p_1, p_2, ..., p_7], so the final answer is 
    [8, 9, 6, 4, 4, 1, 4]
4. output:
    use json to output, the key is "PriorityArray", the value is [8, 9, 6, 4, 4, 1, 4], 
    so the answer is 
    "
    {
        "PriorityArray": [8, 9, 6, 4, 4, 1, 4]
    }
